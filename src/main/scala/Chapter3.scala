   * 1. Generate a free category from:
   * (a) A graph with one node and no edges
   * (b) A graph with one node and one (directed) edge (hint: this
   * edge can be composed with itself)
   * (c) A graph with two nodes and a single arrow between them
   * (d) A graph with a single node and 26 arrows marked with the
   * letters of the alphabet: a, b, c ‚Ä¶ z.
   * 2. What kind of order is this?
   * (a) A set of sets with the inclusion relation: ùê¥ is included in ùêµ
   * if every element of ùê¥ is also an element of ùêµ.
   * (b) C++ types with the following subtyping relation: T1 is a subtype of T2 if a pointer to T1 can be passed to a function that
   * expects a pointer to T2 without triggering a compilation error.
   * 3. Considering that Bool is a set of two values True and False, show
   * that it forms two (set-theoretical) monoids with respect to, respectively, operator && (AND) and || (OR).
   * 4. Represent the Bool monoid with the AND operator as a category:
   * List the morphisms and their rules of composition.
   * 5. Represent addition modulo 3 as a monoid category
